        Parameters
        ----------
        X : array or scipy sparse matrix of shape [n_samples, n_features]
            The input samples.

        threshold : string, float or None, optional (default=None)
            The threshold value to use for feature selection. Features whose
            importance is greater or equal are kept while the others are
            discarded. If "median" (resp. "mean"), then the threshold value is
            the median (resp. the mean) of the feature importances. A scaling
            factor (e.g., "1.25*mean") may also be used. If None and if
            available, the object attribute ``threshold`` is used. Otherwise,
            "mean" is used by default.

        Returns
        -------
        X_r : array of shape [n_samples, n_selected_features]
            The input samples with only the selected features.
