                           SupervisedIntegerMixin, ClassifierMixin):
    """Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_neighbors : int, optional (default = 5)
        Number of neighbors to use by default for :meth:`k_neighbors` queries.

    weights : str or callable
        weight function used in prediction.  Possible values:

        - 'uniform' : uniform weights.  All points in each neighborhood
          are weighted equally.
        - 'distance' : weight points by the inverse of their distance.
          in this case, closer neighbors of a query point will have a
          greater influence than neighbors which are further away.
        - [callable] : a user-defined function which accepts an
          array of distances, and returns an array of the same shape
          containing the weights.

        Uniform weights are used by default.

    algorithm : {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        Algorithm used to compute the nearest neighbors:

        - 'ball_tree' will use :class:`BallTree`
        - 'kd_tree' will use :class:`scipy.spatial.cKDtree`
        - 'brute' will use a brute-force search.
        - 'auto' will attempt to decide the most appropriate algorithm
          based on the values passed to :meth:`fit` method.

        Note: fitting on sparse input will override the setting of
        this parameter, using brute force.

    leaf_size : int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or cKDTree.  This can affect the
        speed of the construction and query, as well as the memory
        required to store the tree.  The optimal value depends on the
        nature of the problem.

    warn_on_equidistant : boolean, optional.  Defaults to True.
        Generate a warning if equidistant neighbors are discarded.
        For classification or regression based on k-neighbors, if
        neighbor k and neighbor k+1 have identical distances but
        different labels, then the result will be dependent on the
        ordering of the training data.
        If the fit method is ``'kd_tree'``, no warnings will be generated.

    p: integer, optional (default = 2)
        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from
        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances. When p = 1, this is
        equivalent to using manhattan_distance (l1), and euclidean_distance
        (l2) for p = 2. For arbitrary p, minkowski_distance (l_p) is used.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X = [[0], [1], [2], [3]]
    >>> y = [0, 0, 1, 1]
    >>> from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
    >>> neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
    >>> neigh.fit(X, y) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    KNeighborsClassifier(...)
    >>> print(neigh.predict([[1.1]]))
    [0]
    >>> print(neigh.predict_proba([[0.9]]))
    [[ 0.66666667  0.33333333]]
