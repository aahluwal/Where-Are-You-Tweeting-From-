def dbscan(X, eps=0.5, min_samples=5, metric='euclidean',

    """Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array [n_samples, n_samples] or [n_samples, n_features]
        Array of distances between samples, or a feature array.
        The array is treated as a feature array unless the metric is given as
        'precomputed'.
    eps: float, optional
        The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered
        as in the same neighborhood.
    min_samples: int, optional
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered
        as a core point.
    metric: string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by metrics.pairwise.calculate_distance for its
        metric parameter.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square.
    random_state: numpy.RandomState, optional
        The generator used to initialize the centers. Defaults to numpy.random.

    Returns
    -------
    core_samples: array [n_core_samples]
        Indices of core samples.

    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.  Noisy samples are given the label -1.

    Notes
    -----
    See examples/plot_dbscan.py for an example.
