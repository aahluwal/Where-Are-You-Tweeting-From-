# The C implementation of fancy indexing is relatively complicated,
# and has many seeming inconsistencies. It also appears to lack any
# kind of test suite, making any changes to the underlying code difficult
# because of its fragility.

# This file is to remedy the test suite part a little bit,
# but hopefully NumPy indexing can be changed to be more systematic
# at some point in the future.
