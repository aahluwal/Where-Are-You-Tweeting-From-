        scikit-learn
        ============
        
        scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of
        SciPy and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.
        
        The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer
        of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. See
        the AUTHORS.rst file for a complete list of contributors.
        
        It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
        
        **Note** `scikit-learn` was previously referred to as `scikits.learn`.

        Dependencies
        ============
        
        The required dependencies to build the software are Python >= 2.6,
        setuptools, Numpy >= 1.3, SciPy >= 0.7 and a working C/C++ compiler.
        
        For running the examples Matplotlib >= 0.99.1 is required and for running the
        tests you need nose >= 0.10.
        
        This configuration matches the Ubuntu 10.04 LTS release from April 2010.
        
        
        Install
        =======
        
        This package uses distutils, which is the default way of installing
        python modules. To install in your home directory, use::
        
          python setup.py install --home
        
        To install for all users on Unix/Linux::
        
          python setup.py build
          sudo python setup.py install
        
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        Code
        ----
        
        GIT
        ~~~
        
        You can check the latest sources with the command::
        
            git clone git://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
        
        or if you have write privileges::
        
            git clone git@github.com:scikit-learn/scikit-learn.git
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        After installation, you can launch the test suite from outside the
        source directory (you will need to have nosetests installed)::
        
           $ nosetests --exe sklearn
        
        See the web page http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html#testing
        for more information.
        
            Random number generation can be controlled during testing by setting
            the ``SKLEARN_SEED`` environment variable.
